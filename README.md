# CNN_based_on_RESNET_9
This dataset contains 101 food categories, with 101,000 images; 250 test images and 750 training images per class. The training images were not cleaned. All images were rescaled to have a maximum side length of 512 pixels.
Trained the Image Dataset consists of 101 different food categories over 100,000 images.
● Implementt he deep learning model based on the RESNET9 model combination of CNN layers, MaxPool and RELU function.
● To avoid overfitting implement the model with Residual blocks and Batch Normalization.
